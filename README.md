Dragnet surveillance and other ridiculous bullshit are making it possible for governments and corporations to retrieve anyone's browsing history. This script generates some noise in that data pool by performing a shitload of dubious Google searches, like "how to make a bomb". Leave it running for a while, pollute the browsing history of your IP address. If there's enough noise, your legitimate searches are obscured and your data profile will not be reliable anymore!

## Running the script
You need Python on your system. Then go to the directory where you downloaded the script and type `python put-me-on-a-watchlist.py` in a Terminal or Command Prompt.

## Running in Docker

Build the container: `docker build -t put-me-on-a-watchlist .`
Run it: `docker run -t --rm put-me-on-a-watchlist`

If you are scared at first, you can do a dry-run without network: `docker run -t --rm --net none put-me-on-a-watchlist`

## Can I talk to you about this script?
Sure, tweet [@n_eufv](https://twitter.com/n_eufv).
